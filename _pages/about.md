I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Bioinformatics Division (BIOIN)](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ifm/bioin) at [Linköping University, Sweden](https://liu.se/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Björn Wallner](https://liu.se/en/employee/bjowa51), who specializes in computational modelling of protein ensembles. Our research lies at the intersection of **biology, statistics, and machine learning**.  
I am supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the **Wenner-Gren Foundation**, focusing on investigating the **conformational landscape of flexible proteins**.

Previously, I completed my doctorate at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi)](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) in 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Durai Sundar](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~sundar/index.html).  
My doctoral work focused on developing computational solutions that integrate diverse biological datasets to aid **prognosis modelling** and **drug discovery**, with applications to NGS datasets of **lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** and **breast cancer (BRCA)** for **survival prediction**.

Before joining IIT Delhi, I earned my **Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Biotechnology** from **GB Pant University, Uttarakhand, India**.  
My undergraduate research, under [Prof. Sanjeev Agarwal](https://gbpuat.ac.in/colleges/CBSH/D1/sanjeev_profile.html), focused on identifying and profiling the **antimicrobial effects of steroidal lactones** from *Withania somnifera*.
