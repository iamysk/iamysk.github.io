## About the Talk

In this talk, I explored the evolving methodologies in **automated software testing** and how these approaches are being shaped by advancements in AI and machine learning. We discussed the limitations of traditional testing frameworks and proposed a hybrid strategy integrating statistical models with adaptive learning techniques.

Key points included:

- Historical challenges in automated test reliability.
- The rise of AI-assisted test generation tools.
- Real-world case studies from enterprise environments.
- Future trends and research directions in intelligent test design.

## Motivation and Impact

With software systems becoming increasingly complex, manual testing is no longer scalable. My presentation emphasized the need for smarter tools that **adapt to changing codebases**, thus reducing human intervention and increasing accuracy. This work has been influenced heavily by ongoing research at Linköping University and field studies in enterprise test environments.

## Conclusion

The response to the talk was overwhelmingly positive, with lively discussions about how we can implement these ideas in real testing pipelines. I concluded with a call for collaboration between academia and industry to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the field of software testing.
