## About the Talk

In this talk, I presented **TransDTI** — a transformer-based language model approach for identifying and predicting **drug–target interactions (DTIs)**. This work aims to overcome the bottlenecks in traditional DTI discovery, offering a powerful, in silico method for accelerating the drug development pipeline.

### Core Contributions

- **TransDTI** introduces a **multiclass classification and regression workflow** that predicts DTIs as **active**, **inactive**, or **intermediate**.
- Leveraging large-scale DTI datasets, our transformer-based models **significantly outperform** existing methods like DeepConvDTI, DeepDTA, and DeepDTI.
- The models demonstrated improvement in metrics such as:
  - **Area under ROC (auROC)**
  - **Area under Precision-Recall (auPR)**
  - **Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**
  - **R² score**
- Validation was done using **molecular docking and simulation**, confirming novel interactions, particularly for **MAP2k** and **TGFβ**.

## Why This Matters

The traditional process of identifying DTIs is **slow, manual, and expensive**. Our solution, powered by transformers, enables **faster and more accurate predictions** from sequence data alone — a major step toward **personalized therapy** and **AI-driven drug recommendations**.

## Audience Takeaways

- Strong interest in integrating TransDTI with hospital and clinical recommendation systems.
- Active discussion around explainability and use of attention maps in understanding DTI mechanisms.
- Feedback suggested applying this model to rare diseases and orphan drug scenarios.

## Conclusion

**TransDTI** represents a practical and scalable solution for next-gen DTI discovery. Its implications span **drug repurposing**, **precision medicine**, and **clinical decision support**. This talk emphasized the power of **transformer models in biomedical research** and the urgent need for AI tools in pharma workflows.
